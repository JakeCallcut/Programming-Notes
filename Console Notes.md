BLOCKED WEBSITES



if you type "ping [desired website]"	// lets say google.com is blocked
						

Pinging google.com [216.58.213.110] with 32 bytes of data:
Reply from 216.58.213.110: bytes=32 time=2337ms TTL=57

Ping statistics for 216.58.213.110:
    Packets: Sent = 4, Received = 4, Lost = 0 (0% loss),
Approximate round trip times in milli-seconds:
    Minimum = 25ms, Maximum = 2337ms, Average = 603ms


if you take the most used IP [216.58.213.110 in this case],
type it into the adress bar you can bypass the smoothwall/block

[you can also ping a certain number of times using "-n [num]"




IP ADDRESSES

if you type "ipconfig" into your CMD,
go to the line that starts with "IPv4 Address"
along the dotted line will be the computers IP
 
you can also use IPv6


 
to shut down an IP address 
type "shutdown -i" 
a window will come up click add and type in an IP address

when you do this you can display a warning,
restart,
aadd a reason,
and add  a comment


[there is a program to block shutdown]


if you type nslookup it will show you the name of your network/server
and a list of ALL IP adresses the server owns
this is useful if you are on a server 

otherwise it wil be under ipconfig > defualt gateway







DDOS ATTACK

open lots of CMD tabs
then you will want to flood the website with ping requests
but put -t at the end of the ping
this will constantly send ping requests forever

[you can also ping an IP to ddos]


Usage: ping [-t] [-a] [-n count] [-l size] [-f] [-i TTL] [-v TOS]
            [-r count] [-s count] [[-j host-list] | [-k host-list]]
            [-w timeout] [-R] [-S srcaddr] [-c compartment] [-p]
            [-4] [-6] target_name

Options:
    -t             Ping the specified host until stopped.
                   To see statistics and continue - type Control-Break;
                   To stop - type Control-C.
    -a             Resolve addresses to hostnames.
    -n count       Number of echo requests to send.
    -l size        Send buffer size.
