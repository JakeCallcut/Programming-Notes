FUNCTIONS

len(variable)					#this will output the length of a variable
str(variable)					#this will turn the variable into a string
variable.upper()				#this turns every character to uppercase
variable.lower()				#this turns every character to lowercase

'''
some functions use dot notation (variable.upper() for example)
rather than putting the variable in the parentheses

this is because dot notation can only be used on string variables

DATE AND TIME

from datetime import datetime			#this line imports the function for the current date and time
print(datetime.now())		#this will output the current date and time in the form DD-MM-YYYY HH:MM:SS.SSSSSS

now.month			#this will only output the current month
now.year 			#this will only output the current year
now.day				#this will only output the current day


from datetime import datetime
now = datetime.now()
print '%02d/%02d/%04d %02d:%02d:%02d' % (now.month, now.day, now.year, now.hour, now.minute, now.second)

						#this slice of code will print the date and time in a nicer format


SUBSTRINGS

example = "this is how to make a substring"
substring = example[0:10]							#the first number is the start of the substring and the last is the last
Print(substring)									#this will print "this is how"

#also, if you leave the character last character blank, the subtring will continue until the end of the string
substring = example[21:]
Print(substring)							#this will print "substring"
